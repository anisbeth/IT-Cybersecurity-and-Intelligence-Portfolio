**TL;DR** I use a consistent workflow: define scope → capture screen while working → take notes → publish a short *video-first* summary and longer write‑up.

## Why video-first
Quick clips help hiring managers see how I actually work. I keep full‑length recordings private and publish edited walk‑throughs.

## Steps
1. Draft a lab plan and checklist.
2. Record with OBS (separate audio tracks).
3. Save terminal logs and config files.
4. Summarize results with annotated screenshots.
5. Publish a 2–5 minute highlight video and link the repo.

> Tip: end each post with a short “what I learned” list.
